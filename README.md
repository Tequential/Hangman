# Hangman

A simple game of hangman. A randomw word is chose from a dictionary (dictionary.txt).

You guess the word, letter by letter with your keyboard.
For each incorrect guess, the image will change.
10 incorrect guesses will create a full image of a hanged man - you lost!
Each correct letter guessed will add to the array displayed at the bottom of the screen.
If you can guess the correct word before full image is generated - you win!
